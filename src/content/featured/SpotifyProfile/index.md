Me and some friends founded Amiroh right after uni and got 1 million NOK in funding from The Norwegion Reasearch Council. It was the most stressful year of my life, but what an experience. Amiroh a mirror with smart lights, touchscreen, videos and music. The mirror can simulate warm-to-cold light, and everything in between.
